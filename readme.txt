Under the hood, **LiveChat offers a number of efficiency features**, such as targeted messages. These, for instance, could be used to automatically pop up on your checkout page if a shopper is inactive.

LiveChat’s personalization features are no match for the competition. You can customize colors and messages to match your website. It’s possible to set up different themes for the mobile experience, and you can add team photos for more personalized interactions.

But that’s not all. It’s a snip to set up quick replies to answer repetitive questions and create chat tags to streamline communication. To ease your customer support processes, you can handle multiple chat windows across different pages.


With LiveChat you can provide 24/7 customer support. During your off-hours, your customers will still be able to message you in the chat widget, as they would do if your team was online. All of their messages will be stored within LiveChat, ready to be replied to.
